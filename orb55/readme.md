# Orb55 keyboard

## Project inspirations

* [Oddbal keyboard](https://atulloh.github.io/oddball/) for the general flatish split keyboard with a 25mm trackball (trackball case inspiration, bill of material, â€¦)
* [Jonas Hietala's keyboard](https://www.jonashietala.se/blog/2024/11/26/building_my_ultimate_keyboard/) as a wiring and firmware example of PMW33XX on a liatris/RP2040
* My [previous keyboard](https://github.com/gcollic/keyboards/tree/main/grimoire60) (itself inspired by TypeMatrix) for the keymap
